# Linked Text

This add-on will make link appear in blue in your chat, and make it clickable to easy copy the link.  
For example if you type discord.gg/YourServer it will become clickable and make a popup when clicked.  
The popup's text is allready highlighted so you can easy copy and paste it.  
This is useable with all kinds of link, such as www.google.com.
